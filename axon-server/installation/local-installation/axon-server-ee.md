# Axon Server EE

## Binaries

The Axon Server EE ZIP download contains executable JAR files for the server itself and the CLI. In addition to the archive file, you would also need a license to run it.

## Setting up Axon Server EE

Unlike Axon Server SE, the setting up and running of an Axon Server EE edition is a longer process which involves the setup of a cluster, creation of contexts and assignment of roles before it can be used for event storage and message routing.

Before we get into the setup, a short introduction to the concept of clusters and contexts within Axon Server EE.

### Clusters/Contexts

A cluster of Axon Server nodes will provide multiple connection points for \(Axon Framework-based\) client applications, and thus share the load of managing message delivery and event storage. Client applications will dynamically connect to a node in the cluster and automatically reconnect to another, should the node that they are currently connected to become unreachable.‌ This ensures a highly available deployment.

Within a single cluster you can define _**contexts**_. Contexts are comparable to logical databases in a RDBMS. They allow for strong segregation without requiring deploying and managing full instances. They may be used for "bounded contexts" in the DDD sense, multi-tenancy \(with a context per tenant\), and have different retention policies.

The [Clustering](../../administration/clustering.md) and [Contexts](../../administration/multi-context.md) sections provide more insights into these aspects.

### Cluster Setup

Setting up a cluster generally involves three steps:

* Provision "uninitialized" Axon Server EE nodes
* Admin Node initialization
* Add additional nodes to the cluster.

#### _Provision Axon Server EE nodes_

To get started with setting up a cluster, you need to provision a set of _**uninitialized**_ nodes. Extract the Enterprise Zip on all the nodes that you want to be part of the cluster. The nodes will need to run on separate ports if run on the same machine.

From the location where the files have been extracted, please run the following command.

```text
$ ./axonserver.jar
     _                     ____
    / \   __  _____  _ __ / ___|  ___ _ ____   _____ _ __
   / _ \  \ \/ / _ \| '_ \\___ \ / _ \ '__\ \ / / _ \ '__|
  / ___ \  >  < (_) | | | |___) |  __/ |   \ V /  __/ |
 /_/   \_\/_/\_\___/|_| |_|____/ \___|_|    \_/ \___|_|
 Enterprise Edition                        Powered by AxonIQ
```

This will start Axon Server EE using the default ports - 8024 for HTTP / 8124 and 8224 for gRPC

The HTTP port is used to serve the Management UI and the REST API provided by Axon Server EE. The gRPC 8124 port is used by Axon Framework client applications to connect to Axon Server EE, while the gRPC 8224 port is used for internal communication between the nodes of an Axon Server EE cluster.

The management UI can be opened at "[http://localhost:8024](http://localhost:8024)" while the REST API is accessible at "[http://localhost:8024/v1](http://localhost:8024/v1)". The REST API provides an operation at "/v1/public/me" to get the configuration details for a running instance of Axon Server EE.

A representation of the response is given below.

```text
{
  "authentication": false,
  "clustered": true,
  "ssl": false,
  "adminNode": false,
  "developmentMode": false,
  "storageContextNames": [],
  "contextNames": [],
  "internalHostName": ${hostname},
  "grpcInternalPort": 8224,
  "grpcPort": 8124,
  "httpPort": 8024,
  "name": ${hostname},
  "hostName": ${hostname}
}
```

Repeat this for every node that needs to be a part of the cluster.

To summarize,

* * Extract the Axon Server EE zip \(along with the license file\) on each node which needs to be part of the cluster and start each instance. 
  * Ensure that the gRPC / internal gRPC ports are open and accessible between the various nodes.
  * The REST API call to each node at "/v1/public/me" gives you the configuration details of the running Axon Server EE instance. This configuration can be customized using the system properties file "axonserver.properties" located within the Axon Server EE distributable. The [System Properties](../../administration/admin-configuration/configuration.md) section details these values.

This completes the process of setting up the unitialized nodes. Next, we need to initialize one of the nodes as the "Admin Node"

#### _Admin Node initialization_

To convert a group of uninitialized Axon Server EE nodes into a cluster, you need to select any one of them as a starting point and run the “init-cluster” command on it. This is done using the "command-line" utility \(axonserver-cli.jar\) available as part of the Axon Server EE distributable.

```text
$ ./axonserver-cli.jar init-cluster
```

Once successfully executed, this will do the following,

* Designate this node as the _admin node_ of the Axon Server EE cluster
* Creates the "admin" context which stores the configuration details of the Axon Server EE cluster
* Creates a "default" context which is available for event storage/message routing for client applications

The REST API operation at "/v1/public/me" should now show the following response _\(assuming axonserver-0 as the hostname of the admin node\)_

```text
{
  "authentication": false,
  "clustered": true,
  "ssl": false,
  "adminNode": true,
  "developmentMode": false,
  "storageContextNames": [ "default" ],
  "contextNames": [ "_admin", "default" ],
  "name": "axonserver-1",
  "hostName": "axonserver-1",
  "internalHostName": "axonserver-1",
  "grpcInternalPort": 8224,
  "grpcPort": 8124,
  "httpPort": 8024
}
```

All admin nodes are member of the “_\_admin_” context, and it is used to distribute cluster structure data in the same way as it distributes Events, Commands, and Queries.

The UI console displays the newly initialized admin node as shown below \(assuming axonserver-1 as the name of the node\)

![Admin Node initialized](https://github.com/domaincomponents/reference-guide-feature/tree/1927f746917a2f2502557f3d4744568cf9336dde/.gitbook/assets/admin_node_initialization.png)

#### _Additional Nodes_

The other nodes can be added to the cluster using the “register-node” command, pointing it at an admin node already in the cluster. On every other node, the following command needs to be executed by pointing to the admin node created above.

```text
$ ./axonserver-cli.jar register-node -h axonserver-1
```

Assuming that the additional node being added has its hostname as "axonserver-2", if the REST API operation at "/v1/public/me" is run against the second node, the following response is shown.

```text
{
  "authentication": false,
  "clustered": true,
  "ssl": false,
  "adminNode": true,
  "developmentMode": false,
  "storageContextNames": [ "default" ],
  "contextNames": [ "_admin", "default" ],
  "name": "axonserver-2",
  "hostName": "axonserver-2",
  "internalHostName": "axonserver-2",
  "grpcInternalPort": 8224,
  "grpcPort": 8124,
  "httpPort": 8024
}
```

To get the complete details of the cluster configuration, the REST API operation at "/v1/public/context" if run against the admin node.

A sample response is shown below \(assuming that the hostnames of the admin node and the additional node are "axonserver-1" and "axonserver-2"\)

```text
[
  {
    "metaData": {},
    "nodes": ["axonserver-1", "axonserver-2"],
    "leader": "axonserver-1",
    "pendingSince": 0,
    "changePending": false,
    "roles": [
      { "role": "PRIMARY", "node": "axonserver-1" },
      { "role": "PRIMARY", "node": "axonserver-2" }
    ],
    "context": "_admin"
  },
  {
    "metaData": {},
    "nodes": ["axonserver-1", "axonserver-2"],
    "leader": "axonserver-1",
    "pendingSince": 0,
    "changePending": false,
    "roles": [
      { "role": "PRIMARY", "node": "axonserver-1" },
      { "role": "PRIMARY", "node": "axonserver-2" }
    ],
    "context": "default"
  }
]
```

The cluster configuration information depicts:

* The leader of the cluster
* The contexts available within the cluster \(in this case "\_admin" and "default"\)
* The nodes within the a cluster
* The roles that the nodes play within a specific context \(in this case PRIMARY i.e. full rights for that context\)

The UI console displays the newly initialized admin node as shown below \(assuming axonserver-1 as the name of the node\)

![Additional node registered.](https://github.com/domaincomponents/reference-guide-feature/tree/1927f746917a2f2502557f3d4744568cf9336dde/.gitbook/assets/admin_node_additional_node1.png)

A production grade setup would require more advanced configuration. For example an Axon Server EE node can be assigned to play different roles within a cluster - it may serve as an admin node, providing services to configure the cluster and keep it running, next to the “regular” event store and messaging functions. It can also be configured to only service specific _**contexts**_ in various roles. Contexts are comparable to logical databases in a RDBMS. They allow for strong segregation without requiring deploying and managing full instances.

This is detailed in the [Clustering](../../administration/clustering.md) and the [Contexts](../../administration/multi-context.md) sections.

This completes a quick basic setup of an Axon Server EE cluster using the default configurations.

To summarize,

* _**The Axon Server EE is not available for event storage or message routing unless a cluster is setup.**_ 
* By default, access control and SSL is not enabled.
* The basic setup involves the creation of an Axon Server EE cluster - This involves configuring an Admin Node and registering additional nodes to the cluster.
* The default ports are 8024/8124 and 8224. These values can be changed via [configuration](../../administration/admin-configuration/).
* The name and hostname default to to the hostname of the system Axon Server EE is running on. These values can be changed via [configuration](../../administration/admin-configuration/) \( “axoniq.axonserver.name” / “axoniq.axonserver.hostname”\).
* The "internalHostName" and "grpcInternalPort" are used for internal communication between the nodes of an Axon Server EE cluster. These values can be changed via [configuration](../../administration/admin-configuration/).

#### _Auto-clustering_

A new feature available since 4.3 is that you can use configuration setting “axoniq.axonserver.autocluster.first” \(in the axonserver.properties file\) to provide it with the hostname of a known Admin node. If that name happens to be the hostname of the node starting up, it will automatically perform the “init-cluster” command on itself if needed. If the name is not the current hostname, it will schedule a task to perform the “register-node” command, which will keep trying until successful, which is when the first node is itself available and initialized. In addition if needed, you can use the “axoniq.axonserver.autocluster.contexts” setting to provide a comma-separated list of contexts to create or join. \(The “\_admin” context needs to be explicitly added if you want all nodes to become admin nodes.\)

### Storage

Axon Server EE creates a folder for each context under a directory named “data”. This is where the events and snapshots for the context\(s\) will be stored. The location can be customized using the “axoniq.axonserver.event.storage” and “axoniq.axonserver.snapshot.storage” settings. Do note that the location customization is applicable for all contexts, you cannot customize it for a specific context.

Axon Server EE will also create a folder for each context under a directory named "log". This is where the replication log for each context is stored. The replication log stores context data as it comes in and is distributed. The storage location for the replication log can be adjusted using the “axoniq.axonserver.replication.log-storage-folder” property. Again, this is applicable for all contexts.

There is also a small database in the “data” directory, which is referred to as the “ControlDB”, and is used for administrative data. This location you can customize by using the “axoniq.axonserver.controldb-path” setting.

The [configuration](../../administration/admin-configuration/) section details the steps required to setup the storage required for Axon Server EE including some advanced options.

### Access Control

As Axon Server is an event store and may contain sensitive data it is always a good practice to enable access control in production and production-like environments.

The [Access Control](../../security/access-control.md) section details the steps required to setup access control in Axon Server EE.

### SSL

Axon Server EE supports TLS/SSL \(Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer\) to encrypt all of Axon Server SE's network traffic - From Axon Framework client applications to Axon Server EE as well as between the various nodes of an Axon Server EE cluster.

The [SSL](../../security/ssl.md) section details the steps required to setup SSL in Axon Server EE.
