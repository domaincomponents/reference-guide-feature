# Deadlines

The 'Deadline' concept in Axon Framework is a mechanism which enables certain actions to be executed after a certain amount of time. The context of this execution is an _**aggregate or a saga**_ in which the deadline was scheduled. If the deadline becomes obsolete there is the possibility to cancel it as well.‌

This section of the reference guide intends to cover in detail the capabilities that the Axon Framework provides to help with scheduling and dealing of deadlines.‌

A summary of the various sub-sections is given below.
