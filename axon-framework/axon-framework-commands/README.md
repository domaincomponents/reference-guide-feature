# Commands

The first type of "Messages" that an Axon application is associated with are _**Command Messages \(or simply Commands\).**_ This section of the reference guide intends to cover in detail the capabilities that the Axon Framework provides to help facilitate Command Message Development.

A summary of the various sub-sections is given below.

| Sub-Section | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Modeling](modeling/) | Axon Framework provided components to address Aggregate Modeling concerns |
| [Command Dispatchers](command-dispatchers.md)/ [Command Handlers](command-handlers.md) | Functional Development concerns for Command Messages using the Axon Framework |
| [Implementations](implementations.md) | Non-Functional Development concerns for Command Messages using the Axon Framework |
| [Configuration](configuration.md) | Configuration concerns for Command Messages using the Axon Framework |

This guide is complemented by a video tutorial which gives a practical demonstration of the concepts explained in this section. The tutorial is available at -&gt; [Axon Coding Tutorial - Command Messages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oy4w5THFEU&feature=youtu.be)
