# Queries

The third and final type of "Messages" that an Axon application is associated with are _**Query Messages \(or simply Queries\).**_ This section of the reference guide intends to cover in detail the capabilities that the Axon Framework provides to help facilitate Query Message Development.

A summary of the various sub-sections is given below.

| :--- | :--- |
| [Query Processing](query-processing.md) | Short introduction to the Query Processing capabilities provided by the Axon Framework |
| [Query Dispatchers](query-dispatchers.md) / [Query Handlers](query-handlers.md) | Functional Development concerns for Query Messages using the Axon Framework |
| [Implementations](implementations.md) | Non-Functional Development concerns for Query Messages using the Axon Framework |
| [Configuration](configuration.md) | Configuration concerns for Query Messages using the Axon Framework |

This guide is complemented by a video tutorial which gives a practical demonstration of the concepts explained in this section. The tutorial is available at -&gt; [Axon Coding Tutorial - Query Messages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS1vfc5EohM&feature=youtu.be)
